- For the full project description, please take a look at Project_Description.pdf
- Synopsis: Given a list of 3-dimensional coordinates, find the optimal path; written in Java.

Notes:
- The program takes in an input file and produces an output file. The first line in the input file is a strictly positive 32-bit integer indicating the number of "city" locations in the 3D space (N). The output file is a list (path) of coordinates indicating the order of the cities visited, resulting in the shortest path or relatively the shortest path; the path ends at the start city (total of N+1).
